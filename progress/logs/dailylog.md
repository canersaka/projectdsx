## Day 0: 
  - I'm not quite sure where the idea for this came to me but I know it was at 9 AM in my Embedded Design class
  - I'm really excited for this idea and am full-sending it, I have already purchased the DS lite and am planning out what else I will purchase and I am researching everything I may need
  - While I wait, I'm going to sketch out schematics, first I think I'm going just get a rough idea of what needs to connect to what
  - If I'm bored I may try to start some CAD for the shell, I'm not 100% sure on the components I will use, so I'm not certain on what the size constraints will be but I will try to get a rough idea of the overall size of the components, but also I might just design it with ergonomics as top priority, and try to work the components around the shell's design.
