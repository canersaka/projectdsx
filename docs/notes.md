##Scope creep
 - So I was thinking it might be cool if this works with an external keyboard, maybe make it dockable? I could make a custom enclosure for a keyboard to make it function as a Laptop?
 - Should I just make it like dockable like a switch? would allow for more intense cooling.
   - Might need like bluetooth input translated to ds inputs if I want to make the DS mode compatible too? But can't forget bottom screen so I would need to get that translated as well
